Factur-X (also called ZUGFeRD in Germany) is a Franco-German standard for
electronic invoices. Structured XML data is embedded in PDF-A/3 files,
allowing invoices to be processed automatically while still being displayed in
standard PDF readers. Factur-X supports EN 16931, the European standard for
electronic invoicing.

See the [Factur-X website (French)](https://www.factur-x.org/) or
[FeRD website (German)](https://www.ferd-net.de/) for more information.

Currently, this library supports reading and writing XML files according to Factur-X Version 1.07.3 (aka ZUGFeRD 2.3.3), as well as reading PDF files containing embedded Factur-X data. Support for embedding XML in PDF files is planned but not yet implemented.

The following Factur-X profiles are currently supported:

- Minimum
- Basic WL
- Basic
- EN 16931 (Comfort)

Extended and XRechnung profiles are not yet supported.

**Warning**: This library is still in early development. The API may change
frequently, and not all features are implemented yet.

## Usage

### Installation

You can install PyCheval from PyPI:

```bash
pip install PyCheval
```

### Generating Factur-X XML

PyCheval supports several Factur-X profile levels, each with different levels of detail and complexity. First, you need to create an instance of the appropriate profile class. Then, you can pass that instance to one of the generation functions.

```python
from datetime import date
from pycheval import EN16931Invoice, Money, generate

invoice = EN16931Invoice(
    invoice_number="2021-123",
    invoice_date=date(2021, 4, 13),
    grand_total=Money("100.00", "EUR"),
    ...  # See the class documentation for all required and optional fields.
)
xml_string = generate(invoice)
```

### Parsing Factur-X PDF files

PyCheval can parse Factur-X PDF files and extract the embedded invoice data. The parser will return an instance of the appropriate profile class.

```python
from pycheval import parse_pdf

invoice = parse_pdf("invoice.pdf")  # Returns MinimumInvoice or a subclass
```

### Printing invoices

To display a formatted Factur-X invoice in the terminal, use the `format_invoice_as_text()` function:

```python
from pycheval import format_invoice_as_text

invoice = EN16931Invoice(...)
print(format_invoice_as_text(invoice))
```
